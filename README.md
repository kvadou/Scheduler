Developed a simple calendar scheduling application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the work day.  This runs in a browser and features dynamically updated HTML, CSS & jQuery.  The time and calendar will update throughout the days to reflect the current time and correspond with the current events in the calendar.  Moment.js is utilized to dynamically update the calendar with current time/date information.  

Time blocks in the calendar will allow the user to input text and save the calendar with new events.  Events will be saved in the calendar after a browser refresh.  Users will be able to toggle between Today, the Previous day and Next day to plan for future calendar events.  The Clear Schedule button will allow the user to completely clear the calendar and wipe all locally stored data.
